# Mini-Project-Map-Gen
## Introduction
 These files contain the progress of my mini-project Map Generation. 
 A camera was attached to the quadcopter and a node was designed with the purpose of capturing images at regular intervals. 
 I used OpenCV to make this happen. A map was designed consisting of a maze made up of walls. Initially the node was designed to take a snap of a single picture however with the help of static integers it was repurposed for snapping images in particular intervals. A survey routine was then decided so as to minimise flight time while simultaneously covering the entire map.
